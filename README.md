# Leonardo Lemos

*PhD Candidate and Scientific Researcher at the Solar Energy Laboratory in the Federal University of Santa Catarina, Brazil*

*From research scientist to data scientist*

Having worked in several research projects, in partnership with Brazilian as well as international research institutions, I have become used to handling large sets of weather data, dealing with complex energy system simulations which required attention to details, as well as working with fellow researchers from diverse cultural backgrounds.

Currently a PhD Candidate at the Federal University of Santa Catarina, I have authored or co-authored three scientific papers in the *Renewable Energy* journal, and also presented several works at international solar energy conferences.

This porfolio is a record of my current studies in ***data science***, including projects related to my doctoral research as well as novel projects from a data scientist's learning path.

Background in: MATLAB, Python, TRNSYS, thermal systems simulation, mathematical modelling
