Having worked in several Brazilian and international research projects, I have developed analytic skills and attention to details, handling large sets of weather and energy production data, as well as implementing complex energy systems simulations for industrial applications and utility-scale energy production. 

As a scientific researcher, I have authored or co-authored three scientific papers in the *Renewable Energy* journal, and also presented several works at international solar energy conferences.

Now I apply this experience to data science problems, mixing a professional scientist perspective to data manipulation techniques, in order to solve real-world problems. This porfolio is a record of my works in ***Python*** and ***Data Science***, as well as projects related to my doctoral research.

Background in: Python, MATLAB, TRNSYS, EES, thermal systems simulation, mathematical modelling

### Repositories available:
