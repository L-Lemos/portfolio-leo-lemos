# Leonardo Lemos

*PhD Candidate and Scientific Researcher at the Solar Energy Laboratory from the Federal University of Santa Catarina, Brazil*

*From research scientist to data scientist*

Having worked in several Brazilian and international research projects, I have developed analytic skills and attention to details, handling large sets of weather and energy production data, as well as implementing complex energy systems simulations for industrial applications and utility-scale energy production. 

Currently a PhD Candidate at the Federal University of Santa Catarina, I have authored or co-authored three scientific papers in the *Renewable Energy* journal, and also presented several works at international solar energy conferences.

This porfolio is a record of my current studies in ***Python*** and ***Data Science***, including projects related to my doctoral research, personal projects, as well as practice projects from a data scientist's learning path.

Background in: Python, MATLAB, TRNSYS, EES, thermal systems simulation, mathematical modelling
