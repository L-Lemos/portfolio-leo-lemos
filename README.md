*PhD Candidate and Scientific Researcher at the Solar Energy Laboratory in the Federal University of Santa Catarina, Brazil*

*From research scientist to data scientist*

Having worked in several Brazilian and international research projects, I have developed analytic skills and attention to details, having handled large sets of weather and energy production data, as well as implementing complex energy system simulations for industrial applications and utility-scale energy production. 

Furthermore, I had the opportunity to work with fellow researchers from diverse cultural backgrounds.

Currently a PhD Candidate at the Federal University of Santa Catarina, I have authored or co-authored three scientific papers in the *Renewable Energy* journal, and also presented several works at international solar energy conferences.

This porfolio is a record of my current studies in ***data science***, including projects related to my doctoral research as well as novel projects from a data scientist's learning path.

Background in: Python, MATLAB, TRNSYS, thermal systems simulation, mathematical modelling
